# Ideas

Some ideas that may be interesting to implement

* nxn dimensional matrix library
* nxn dimensional matrix library in shader form
* nn on webgl shader
* tensors
* spatial vector algebra
* cat theory visualisations - monads
* computation via monoidal diagrams
* gas/fluid shader
* sea shader
* 3d fractals
* other raymarching techniques
* hill/more intense muscle model
* nonlinear control techniques
* loading 3d models
* simulation of shrodinger eq
* quantum computer simulator
* watercolor simulator
* lisp interpreter
* fft
* Four bar linkage.
* homoiconic template language for writing provably correct, fast numerical
  simulations. A focus on building stuff, not the overhead of learning
  programming language theory or fighting the compiler. Really helpful debug
  messages. Memory management? Easy hooking into plotting software,
  parallelization, and 3d visualization. Embellished functions to keep track of
  intermediate things? Have the compiler enforce correct multiplications?
* doodle viewer -> see a doodle upper bar, pull out drawer.
