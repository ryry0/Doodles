# Ideas

Some ideas that may be interesting to implement

how can I use programming to exponentially amplify my output? What can I automate? elmlectron for desktop apps

* elm html math
* doodle viewer -> see a doodle upper bar, pull out drawer. 
* ~~nxn dimensional matrix library~~
* nxn dimensional matrix library in shader form
* nn on webgl shader
* tensors
* spatial vector algebra
* cat theory visualisations - monads
* computation via monoidal diagrams
* gas/fluid shader
* sea shader
* 3d fractals
* other raymarching techniques
* hill/more intense muscle model
* nonlinear control techniques
* loading 3d models
* simulation of shrodinger eq
* quantum computer simulator
* watercolor simulator
* lisp interpreter with visualization
* fft
* Four bar linkage.
* 3 concentric ring thing
* homoiconic template language for writing provably correct, fast numerical
  simulations. A focus on building stuff, not the overhead of learning
  programming language theory or fighting the compiler. Really helpful debug
  messages. Memory management? Easy hooking into plotting software,
  parallelization, and 3d visualization and GUIs. Did I mention fast?  Have the
  compiler enforce correct multiplications?  Something like processing?
  Spontaneous good structuring, instead of bad habits.  Embellished functions to
  keep track of intermediate things? Have unsafe blocks of c or pythonic style
  imperative. Make a test drive version in the browser. Compile to C or Julia
  Python Matlab
  recur language https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-recurs/index.html
  tail call recursion https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/. Compiler hints to do
  operations in place and for checking for tail call recursion.
* Inertia matrix visualizer. Add minecraft cubes and compute I matrix from that
  shit.
* automated test writing
