A `Point3d` represents a position in 3D space and is defined by its X, Y and Z
coordinates. This module contains a variety of point-related functionality, such
as

  - Measuring distance between points, or the distance of a point from an axis
    or a plane
  - Scaling, rotating, translating, mirroring and projecting points
  - Converting points between different coordinate systems

Points are distinct from vectors but interact with them in well-defined ways;
you can translate a point by a vector to result in a new point, or you can
compute the vector from one point to another, but you cannot 'add' two points
like you can add two vectors.
